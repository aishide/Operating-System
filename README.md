# Operating-System

Operating Systems Lab Summary (2024–25)
Instructor: Dr. Princy Diwan
University: Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Nagpur

This report summarizes the practical work completed in the Operating Systems Lab during the academic session 2024–25. The lab aimed to provide hands-on experience with key OS concepts like process management, CPU scheduling, memory management, and shell scripting.

Practicals Performed:
1. Basic Linux Commands: Executed common Ubuntu commands (ls, pwd, etc.) to understand file and directory operations.
2. C Programming with vi Editor: Wrote and executed simple C programs using the vi editor.
3. Process Creation: Used fork() in C to demonstrate parent-child process interaction.
4. FCFS Scheduling: Implemented the First-Come, First-Served algorithm to understand basic scheduling.
5. SJF Scheduling: Simulated Shortest Job First scheduling to optimize average waiting time.
6. Priority Scheduling: Developed a program to schedule processes based on priority values.
7. Banker’s Algorithm: Implemented deadlock avoidance using Banker's Algorithm to ensure safe resource allocation.
8. Shell Commands & Scripting: Practiced shell scripts for automating tasks and implemented commands using C.
9. If-Else in Shell Scripts: Created scripts using conditional statements to handle basic decision-making.

Learning Outcomes:
Understood core OS concepts including process scheduling and deadlock avoidance.

Gained practical skills in system-level programming using C and Bash.

Learned to automate tasks using shell scripting.

Tools Used:
Language: C
Shell: Bash
OS: Ubuntu Linux
Compiler: GCC

Conclusion:
The lab offered foundational knowledge in operating systems through practical implementation, strengthening both conceptual understanding and programming skills.
